# Architecture Decision Records

Record every significant, hard-to-reverse choice here: library selection, provider choice, data
model trade-offs, delivery guarantees, security boundaries, and deployment topology.

## Conventions

- File name: `NNNN-short-kebab-title.md`, numbered sequentially and never renumbered.
- Status: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded by NNNN`, or `Deprecated`.
- Do not rewrite an accepted ADR's decision. Supersede it with a new ADR and link both ways.
  Clarifications and "consequences observed" notes may be appended with a date.
- Reference official documentation with the version and date checked. Never cite an API, version,
  or Azure SKU that has not been verified.

## Template

```markdown
# NNNN. Title

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by NNNN
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Milestone: NN

## Context
What forces are at play: requirements, constraints, verified facts.

## Decision
What we chose, stated plainly.

## Alternatives considered
Options rejected and why.

## Consequences
Positive, negative, and follow-up work. How we would detect that the decision is wrong.

## References
Official documentation (with version and date checked).
